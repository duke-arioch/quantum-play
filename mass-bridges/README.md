# Geometric Genesis: Mass & Lifetime Ladders in Quantum Geometry

This directory contains a series of papers exploring how mass, particle dynamics, and cosmological phenomena emerge from fundamental quantum geometric processes.

## Papers Overview

**Paper A** ([paper-a.tex](paper-a.tex)): **Dual-Anchored Excitations**
- Introduces dual-anchored bridge processes as fundamental particle excitations
- Develops operator-algebraic framework using Jones inclusions
- Presents brachiation model for particle motion in quantum geometry
- Establishes connection between quantum geometry and particle physics

**Paper B** ([paper-b.tex](paper-b.tex)): **Dynamic Index Budget**
- Explores index budget constraints on collective quantum states
- Investigates cosmological phase transitions in geometric frameworks
- Develops tools for understanding large-scale structure formation

**Paper C** ([paper-c.tex](paper-c.tex)): **Mass & Lifetime Ladders**
- Derives particle mass relationships from geometric constraints
- Connects quantum geometry to observable particle properties
- Establishes systematic approach to mass spectrum generation

**Paper D** ([paper-d.tex](paper-d.tex)): **Emergent Spacetime & Cosmology**
- Shows how classical spacetime emerges from quantum geometric processes
- Derives dark matter abundance (Ω_DM/Ω_B ≈ 5.4) and cosmological constant
- Provides falsifiable predictions connecting expansion rate to index density
- Completes the bridge from pre-geometric foam to observable cosmology

## Status

** Work in Progress**: These papers represent ongoing research into the Geometric Genesis framework. Mathematical formulations, calculations, and some theoretical foundations are still under development and review.
