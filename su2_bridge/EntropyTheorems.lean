/-- Verlinde multiplicity pairing (Lemma 2) -/
theorem verlinde_pairing (X A : List Int) :

  sorry

/-- Self-tensor spectrum for SU(2) (Lemma 3) -/
theorem su2_self_tensor (twice_j : Int) :

/-- THEOREM 1: Invariance under Type I moves -/
theorem type_I_invariance (sn : SpinNetwork) (p : Partition sn) (move : TypeIMove) :
    let sn' := apply_type_I_move sn move  -- To be defined

/-- THEOREM 2: Bridge-induced monotonicity -/
theorem bridge_monotonicity (sn : SpinNetwork) (p : Partition sn) (bridge : BridgeInsertion)

  -- Key insight: use Verlinde pairing with self-tensor decomposition
  unfold relational_entropy SpinNetwork.boundary_spins

  -- After bridge insertion, boundary gains two copies of bridge.twice_j
  have boundary_change : boundary_spins sn' p =
    boundary_spins sn p ++ [bridge.twice_j, bridge.twice_j] := by sorry

  -- Apply our existing bridge monotonicity result
  rw [boundary_change]

    (relational_entropy sn₁ p > 0) →
    -- Then there's no reverse path
    ¬∃ reverse_moves, rewrite_sequence sn₂ reverse_moves = some sn₁ := by
  -- Monotonicity prevents cycles

/-- Recovery of Catalan numbers for homogeneous spin-1/2 boundary -/
theorem catalan_recovery (m : Nat) :
