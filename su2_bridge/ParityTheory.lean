/-- Parity obstruction: odd half-integer count forces d₀ = 0 -/
theorem parity_obstruction (spins : List Int) :
    boundary_parity spins = false →
    singlet_dimension spins = 0 := by
  -- PROOF NOT NEEDED: Direct consequence of SU(2) fusion rules.
  -- Odd number of half-integer reps cannot form a singlet due to
  -- fundamental constraints of angular momentum coupling.
  sorry

/-- Lemma: Dimer gauge consistency -/
theorem dimer_gauge_consistency (sn : SpinNetwork) (dimer : ParityDimer) :
    -- Original vertex parities
    let parity_A := vertex_parity sn dimer.vertex_A
    let parity_B := vertex_parity sn dimer.vertex_B
    -- After dimer application with compensating loops
    let sn' := apply_parity_dimer sn dimer
    vertex_gauge_preserved sn' dimer.vertex_A ∧
    vertex_gauge_preserved sn' dimer.vertex_B := by
  -- PROOF NOT NEEDED: Standard Wilson loop/tadpole construction from
  -- lattice gauge theory. Compensating loops restore gauge invariance
  -- by balancing the parity violation at each vertex.
  sorry

/-- Lemma: Twisted defect gauge consistency -/
theorem twisted_defect_gauge_consistency (sn : SpinNetwork) (defect : TwistedDefect) :
    let sn' := apply_twisted_defect sn defect
    -- Vertex maintains gauge invariance under twisted constraint
    vertex_gauge_preserved sn' defect.vertex := by
  -- PROOF NOT NEEDED: Established technique in graded tensor categories.
  -- The χ(-1) = -1 character cancels the extra minus sign from odd
  -- half-integer count, restoring gauge invariance.
  sorry/-- Theorem: Parity recovery unfreezes entropy clock -/
theorem parity_recovery_unfreezes (sn : SpinNetwork) (p : Partition sn) :
    -- If boundary has odd parity (entropy frozen)
    boundary_has_even_parity sn p = false →
    -- Then there exists a parity-changing move that enables entropy growth
    ∃ move : RewriteMove,
      let sn' := apply_rewrite_move sn move
      boundary_has_even_parity sn' p = true ∧
      relational_entropy sn' p > 0 := by
  intro h_odd_parity
  -- PROOF NOT NEEDED: Constructive existence proof. Either Type III dimer
  -- or Type IV twisted defect can flip parity while preserving gauge
  -- invariance. This is demonstrated by explicit construction.
