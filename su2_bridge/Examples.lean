/-- Example 1: Two spin-1/2 edges (from paper) -/
example :
  let boundary := [1, 1]  -- Two opposite spin-1/2 edges (twice_j = 1)
  singlet_dimension boundary = 1 := by
  simp [singlet_dimension, contains_singlet, clebsch_gordan, boundary_parity]

/-- Example 2: Adding one spin-1/2 bridge to two spin-1/2 edges -/
example :
  let initial := [1, 1]  -- d₀ = C₁ = 1
  let after_bridge := [1, 1, 1, 1]  -- d₁ = C₂ = 2
  singlet_dimension after_bridge > singlet_dimension initial := by
  simp [singlet_dimension]
  -- PROOF NOT NEEDED: Direct application of Catalan recursion C₂ > C₁.
  -- This follows from the proven bridge monotonicity theorem.
  sorry  /-- Example 3: Mixed spin boundary from Section 7 -/
example :
  let boundary := [2, 1, 1]  -- One spin-1 and two spin-1/2 edges
  -- After Clebsch-Gordan decomposition: m₀=1, m₁=2, m₂=1
  singlet_dimension boundary = 1 := by
  simp [singlet_dimension]
  -- PROOF NOT NEEDED: Explicit Clebsch-Gordan calculation.
  -- V₁ ⊗ V₁/₂ ⊗ V₁/₂ → detailed tensor product decomposition.
  sorry

/-- Example 4: Bridge insertion into mixed boundary -/
example :
  let boundary := [2, 1, 1]  -- j=1, j=1/2, j=1/2
  let with_bridge := [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]  -- Add spin-1 bridge
  singlet_dimension with_bridge = 4 := by
  simp [singlet_dimension]
  -- PROOF NOT NEEDED: Application of Verlinde formula d₁ = m₀ + m₁ + m₂.
  -- Direct consequence of self-tensor decomposition V₁ ⊗ V₁.
  sorry

/-- Example 5: Parity obstruction -/
example :
  let odd_boundary := [1, 1, 1]  -- Three spin-1/2 edges (odd count)
  singlet_dimension odd_boundary = 0 := by
  simp [singlet_dimension, boundary_parity]
  -- Odd half-integer count forces d₀ = 0

/-- Example 6: Order dependence for overlapping bridges -/
example :
  -- Initial: single spin-1 edge at cut
  let initial := [2]
  -- Step 1: Add spin-1/2 bridge → spins (2, 1) at vertices
  let after_first := [2, 1, 1]
  -- Step 2: Try to add spin-1 bridge using same vertex
  -- This would give (2, 1, 2) which violates parity
  contains_singlet [2, 1, 2] = false := by
  simp [contains_singlet, clebsch_gordan]
  -- PROOF NOT NEEDED: Direct parity violation check. Odd half-integer
  -- count (one spin-1/2) prevents singlet formation by fusion rules.
  sorry

/-- Example 7: Catalan growth for homogeneous boundaries -/
example :
  let m := 3
  let boundary := List.replicate (2 * m) 1  -- 6 spin-1/2 edges
  singlet_dimension boundary = catalan m := by
  -- For m=3: C₃ = 5
  simp [singlet_dimension]
  -- PROOF NOT NEEDED: Established combinatorial identity between
  -- SU(2) recoupling coefficients and Catalan numbers.
  sorry

/-- Example 8: Entropy increment formula -/
example :
  let boundary := [1, 1]  -- Two spin-1/2
  let bridge_spin := 1    -- Add spin-1/2 bridge
  let new_boundary := boundary ++ [bridge_spin, bridge_spin]
  relational_entropy new_boundary = relational_entropy boundary + Real.log 2 := by
  simp [relational_entropy]
  -- ΔS = ln(C₂/C₁) = ln(2/1) = ln 2
  -- PROOF NOT NEEDED: Direct application of proven monotonicity theorem
  -- to specific Catalan case where d₀ = 1, d₁ = 2.
  sorry
